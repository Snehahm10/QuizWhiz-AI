## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js version 18 or newer installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quizwhiz-ai.git
cd quizwhiz-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install all the necessary project dependencies using npm. This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads the required libraries.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

For the application to connect to Firebase and Google AI services, you need to provide your API keys and configuration details.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2.  Copy the following content into the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

```env
# Firebase Configuration
# You can get these values from your Firebase project's settings page.
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"

# Google AI API Key for Genkit
# You can generate this from Google AI Studio.
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
```

*Note: The project also has a fallback Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase.ts`. However, using a `.env` file is the recommended and more secure approach.*

### 4. Run the Development Server

Now you're ready to start the application. Run the following command to launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Next.js application with Turbopack for faster performance. It also starts the Genkit AI flows required for generating quiz questions.

### 5. Open the Application

Once the server is running, you'll see a message in your terminal. Open your web browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

You should now see the QuizWhiz AI login page. You can create an account and start using the app!
